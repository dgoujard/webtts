# About This Repository
This repository creates a Docker image for an Apache-based webserver running a small PHP script to access the Pico Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine for generating sound files from text. It can be useful for home automation systems or any application where speech feedback is required via a local web service.

The configuration is based on the guide found here: https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Use-local-TTS-with-squeezebox

The Docker image can be found here: https://hub.docker.com/r/syphr/webtts/
